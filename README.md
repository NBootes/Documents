# DKblock documents -  
Here is a YouTube video, curtusey of Nick Jobbitt of a 10 block build, sped up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V05_WOhEqQg&feature=youtu.be
All documents can be opened in OpenOffice format or Adobe Acrobat Reader and PCB files are in EAGLE format. Some drawing files are in Alibre Design (for example AD_DRW extension). Please note that if your CAD program cannot read these files, not to worry because most CAD programs can output formats that can be read by other CAD programs, so please ask if you would like another format, we will try to accomodate.
