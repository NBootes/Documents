# DKblock documents -  
All documents can be opened in OpenOffice format or Adobe Acrobat Reader and PCB files are in EAGLE format. Some drawing files are in Alibre Design (for example AD_DRW extension). Please note that if your CAD program cannot read these files, not to worry because most CAD programs can output formats that can be read by other CAD programs, so please ask if you would like another format, we will try to accomodate.

Once approved by Nick, Here is a YouTube video on a 10 block build, sped up. (does he have any more that he is willing to share?)
